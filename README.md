TFG-Videojocs

The objective of this TFG is the creation of a 2D video game of the Roguelike / Roguelite genre, but due to the limitations of the project, the aim is to create a demo level that will serve as a sketch of the main elements of the video game.

In this level the player will go around with the character eliminating enemies and getting improvements to their stats with the aim of defeating the final boss of the level. All that we achieve during the game is lost both when we die and at the end of the game, and both the enemies and the upgrades must be random.

The explanatory video is inside the "Explanatory video" folder and the executable of the videogame is inside the "Executable" folder.

To play the game you must download the "Executable" folder and start the Ninjutsu.exe file.
