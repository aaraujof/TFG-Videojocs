# TFG-Videojocs: NINJUTSU

The objective of this TFG is the creation of a 2D video game of the Roguelike / Roguelite genre, but due to the limitations of the project, the aim is to create a demo level that will serve as a sketch of the main elements of the video game.

In this level the player will progress the character through a series of rooms while eliminating enemies and gaining upgrades to their stats. The objective of the game is to defeat the final boss of the level and everything that is achieved throughout the game is lost whether the character dies or wins the game by killing the boss. Due to the genre, enemies, upgrades and room generation in the level will have to be randomised.

To play the game you must download the "Executable" folder and start the Ninjutsu.exe file.
*You must be careful that the antivirus does not consider it as a malicious or unknown file. In this case, you must remove the .exe from the quarantine and put it in the same folder where it was initially.
